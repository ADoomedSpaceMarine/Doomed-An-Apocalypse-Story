Decorate/zScript/ACS coding: 
- Myself, ADoomedSpaceMarine

Sprites: 
- Myself, ADoomedSpaceMarine & Some Resources used from Realm 667 (Modified for Demon's Bane reload sprite) and "Babby's First Zscript 
  Over and under" for a portion of the two barrels used in shell insertion. Many of the borrowed sprites started as 2-4 base sprites that I 
  created animation frames for.
- Realm 667 For characters 
- HellForged for the Acrobat's sprite
- Cat's Visor Resources by Schrodinger's Cat
- Shells for AR36 were found on FreePNG.Com
- AR36 originated from a user named Captain J's page.
- Some Edits to add reload to AR were done myself
- The bubble shield pickup was made by myself after making some minor alterations to the blursphere
- The Battlehawk some origin sprites from Yukes Van Faust's Armory found here https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=58655
- Some ammo sprites online
- D3Stakler for the EPIC BFL expansion sprites 
- JoeyTD, Minigunner - Glock 18
- The Tricannon originated from Captain J's resource page, found here: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=37556
- So did the 4 base sprites for the UAC-12
