+Added a few redone sounds
!Fixed bugs with the hud projection of ammo counters, specifically for the clips of a few weapons to properly show the bar for full ammo and it's depletion.
+Kinda entirely overhauled the PR96 Plasma Rifle in a lot of ways, new fire speeds, and reworking of sprite ordering when firing.
+Added recoil to a number of guns. Yes, the big guns will now actually slow you down a bit. Especially the chain cannons and BFL.
*Redid starting load out for a couple of the classes.
!Fixed various bugs with the suit powerup system. There's a small issue with the Haste module, but that will probably be hotfixed.
?A bunch of other shit I can't remember right now.
